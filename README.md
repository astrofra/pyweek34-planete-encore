# PyWeek34: Planete Encore

## Game entry for the PyWeek 34

Game prototype for the [PyWeek 34](https://pyweek.org/) game jam. Made with [HARFANG 3D](https://www.harfang3d.com).<br>
Tribute to Jean `Moebius` Giraud.<br>
_Planete Encore_ is implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/) :snake:<br>

The theme of PyWeek 34 was `Red Planet`, a very inspiring theme that almost quickly directed me toward the universe of Jean `Moebius` Giraud, the French genius of fantasy & sci-fo graphic novels:

I tried to recreate its iconic character with a long hat.

The rendering of the game relies on HARFANG's `AAA` 3D pipeline, able to render GI & reflections in screen space on a non-RTX GPU.
